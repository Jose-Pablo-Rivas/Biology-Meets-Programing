## This array, denoted Skew, is defined by setting Skew[i] equal to the number of occurrences of G minus the number of occurrences of C in the first i nucleotides of Genome (see figure below). We also set Skew[0] equal to zero

# Input:  A String Genome
# Output: The skew array of Genome as a list.
def SkewArray(Genome):
    Skew=[0]
    for i in range(0, len(Genome)):
        if Genome[i]=='C':
            Skew.append(Skew[i]-1)
        elif Genome[i]=='G':
            Skew.append(Skew[i]+1)
        else:
            Skew.append(Skew[i])
    return (Skew)
